## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties


### What I learned

First attempt of a frontend mentour challenge, after using web.dev and KevinPowell tutorials for html and css. Also had to learn the basics of git and github withing VScode too.


### Continued development

Continue to develop html and css skills, and learn more of github. Then start courses on JS.

### Useful resources

- [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This helped me to look up and understand semantic html and css.
