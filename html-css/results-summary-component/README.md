## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

I implemented a lot of new things, in the tutorials I watched today - in regards to using (data item type) to allow accent colours to be added to the svgs.  I also deep dived into custom variables, and sank a lot of these into it! however I wont be doing this for simple designs again, I can see how it would really benefit a large development though.


```css
.this-css[data-item-type="accent-3"] {
    --item-color: var(--clr-accent-3);
}

```


### Continued development

deeper dive into margins and repetiveness, so i can get spacing more quickly - love to memorise the rem numbers for corresponding px.

### Useful resources

Kevin Pwell on Youtube - been really good at explaining the consepts I implemented.
